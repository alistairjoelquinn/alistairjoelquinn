## Hi, I'm Alistair 👋

I'm a developer from Glasgow, Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿, who is passionate about education and empowering people through tech. I'm a former Bootcamp Teacher 👨🏻‍🏫, currently working as a Full Stack Engineer ⚛️ at a company in Berlin 🇩🇪 helping startups get government funding for innovative and high risk R&D.
 
In my spare time I like to make fun games for my children 👶🏻 in Rust 🦀.
